# Data-augmentation
Data augmentation in data analysis are techniques used to increase the amount of data by adding slightly modified copies of already existing data or newly created synthetic data from existing data.
It acts as a regularizer and helps reduce overfitting when training a machine learning model.

Transformations of images : Geometric transformations, flipping, color modification, cropping, rotation, noise injection and random erasing are used to augment image in deep learning.

In this project we apply various changes(flip, crop, rotate or zoom...) to the initial data which is 'img.jpeg'. and saving 5 augmented images in the output folder .
